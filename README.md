## Zero To Production in Rust
My implementation of the project given in the textbook Zero To Production In Rust by Luca Palmeri.
Implemented using the Axum web framework rather than the Actix Web framework used in the book.
I was doing this to prepare for a university project and wanted to gain experience with the tools I was planning on using.
