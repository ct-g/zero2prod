    Investigate usage of Axum's typed headers from "headers" feature flag

Building
    See if sqlx metadata requires updating or not.
        cargo sqlx prepare --check

    Generate metadata for sql queries. Necessary for docker image to build successfully.
    Uses sqlx offline features.
        cargo sqlx prepare -- --lib

    Build docker image. The '.' argument gives current directory as build context.
    I.e. nothing outside this directory can be accessed when building the docker image.
        docker build --tag zero2prod --file Dockerfile .

Migrations
    Local
        SKIP_DOCKER=true ./scripts/init_db.sh

    Production - temporarily set database to accept untrusted sources before running this
    Get connection string from dashboard
    Remember to update sqlx-data.json file for compatibility
        DATABASE_URL=connection_string sqlx migrate run

Running
    The argument -p forces the container to expose its ports for networking.
        docker run -p 8000:8000 zero2prod

    Pipe into bunyan for formatted logs
        docker run -p 8000:8000 zero2prod | bunyan

Post-Mortem
    App compiles and passes tests
    Failed to send confirmation email in production
    Attempting to resubmit email fails to insert into DB as it already exists
        Ideally, only inserted into DB after confirmation email is successfully sent
    Failure appears to be due to some restrictions on PostMark account
